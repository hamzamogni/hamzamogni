### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an about to graduate software engineer specializing in Geographical Information Systems (GIS), I have more than 4 years of working as a professional Full-Stack developer in paralell with my studies, during those 4 years, I have used a multitude of languages like PhP, Python, Javascript and Dart.

I am proficient in and worked most with Laravel, VueJS, NuxtJS, Flutter and Django. I especially enjoy learning about software architecture and design patterns and apply what I learn in projects I work on.

I am planning to transition to Data Engineering, lately I have started learning about the topic and I am documenting the process through a series of posts and threads on Twitter, Linkedin and Medium.
